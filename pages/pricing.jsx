  },
  {
    q: 'What is the Exam Pass?',
    a: `One payment for ${EXAM_PASS_DAYS} days of everything in Pro. It never renews and there is nothing to cancel — access simply ends on the date shown in your account. It suits a learner whose test is a few weeks away, and it is the option we recommend where cards often reject recurring payments.`,
  },
  {
    q: 'Can I cancel anytime?',
    a: 'Yes. Cancel a subscription whenever you like from your account and you keep Pro access until the end of the period you have already paid for. There are no cancellation fees, and the Exam Pass has nothing to cancel because it never renews.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What is free, and what needs Pro?',
    a: `${FREE_COPY.pricingFaq} Pro adds full AI Writing reports on all four criteria, AI Speaking scoring, minutes with the live gpt-live-1 examiner, timed full mocks, trend insights, and an ad-free experience.`,
  },
  {
    q: 'What exactly are the fair-use limits on Pro?',
    a: 'Pro includes up to 2 AI Writing reports per day, 10 per week and 30 per month, plus up to 1 AI Speaking score per day, 5 per week and 15 per month. All three limits apply. Daily limits reset at midnight UTC, weekly limits on Monday at midnight UTC, and monthly limits on the first day of the month at midnight UTC. Your plan also includes minutes with the live gpt-live-1 examiner, which is full-duplex — it listens while it speaks. If you reach a scoring limit, your saved feedback stays available while you wait for that allowance to reset.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How accurate are the AI band scores?',
    a: 'Scores are an estimate marked against the public IELTS band descriptors, criterion by criterion. Treat the band as a guide within about half a band, and use the specific per-criterion feedback and corrected sentences to improve.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Why might my price differ from someone in another country?',
    a: 'Prices are set from the region your request comes from, so learners in lower-income regions pay less. Regional pricing is applied on the server and cannot be selected in the browser.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Is my payment information secure?',
    a: 'Yes. Checkout is handled by Stripe, a PCI-compliant payment provider. Your card details go directly to Stripe — IELTS-Bank never sees or stores them.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Is IELTS-Bank affiliated with the official IELTS test?',
    a: 'No. IELTS-Bank provides original practice material and is not affiliated with or endorsed by the IELTS partners (British Council, IDP or Cambridge Assessment English).',

              anchors every score to the public band descriptors, criterion by criterion, and shows
