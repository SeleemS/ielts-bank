                  IELTS-Bank.com (&quot;we,&quot; &quot;us,&quot; or &quot;our&quot;) is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, share, and safeguard information when you visit our website, and describes your rights under applicable privacy laws, including the EU/UK General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and US state privacy laws such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA/CPRA).

                <p>
                  <strong className="font-semibold text-foreground">Information you provide:</strong> Most practice content can be used without an account. If you sign in, we process your email address, account identifier, practice attempts, scores, learning preferences and quota usage so we can provide progress tracking and AI feedback. If you subscribe to updates, we store your email address and signup source. Contact-form messages are used only to respond to your request.
                </p>
                <p className="mt-2">
                  <strong className="font-semibold text-foreground">Automatically collected information:</strong> We collect standard log and device data including your IP address, browser type, operating system, referring URLs, pages visited, and time spent on pages.

                  <strong className="font-semibold text-foreground">Cookies and similar technologies:</strong> We and our third-party partners use cookies, local storage, and similar technologies to operate the site, analyze traffic, remember your preferences, and serve advertisements.

                <p>
                  Submitted Writing responses and scoring results may be stored with a signed-in learner&apos;s attempt history. Speaking recordings are uploaded only for scoring and are deleted after the scoring request completes; a scheduled cleanup also removes any recording older than 30 days. Writing text and speaking audio are sent to our AI provider to generate the feedback you request. Do not submit sensitive personal information in practice answers.

                <p>
                  If you purchase a premium subscription, payments are processed by Stripe, our payment processor. We do not store your full card details on our servers; Stripe processes your payment information under its own privacy policy and security standards. We retain records of your subscription status and billing history as needed to provide the service and comply with tax and accounting obligations.

                <p>
                  We work with third-party advertising partners to display ads on our site. These include Google AdSense. These partners may use cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies to collect information about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you, measure ad performance, and prevent fraud.
                </p>
                <p className="mt-2">
                  Depending on your location, personalized advertising is only served with your consent (see Section 6). You can also opt out of personalized advertising through the following resources:

                <p className="mt-2">
                  We also use Google Analytics, Vercel Analytics and limited first-party event telemetry to understand page visits and feature usage. Anonymous telemetry uses a random identifier stored in your browser and does not include essays, transcripts, audio or email addresses. You can opt out of Google Analytics with the <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" className="text-primary underline-offset-2 hover:underline">Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on</a>.

                <p>
                  Where required by law (including in the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, and certain US states), we will request your consent before setting non-essential cookies or serving personalized advertising. You may accept or decline optional cookies via the consent banner, and you can change or withdraw your choice at any time through the &quot;Privacy choices&quot; control on our site or by adjusting your browser&apos;s cookie settings. Declining non-essential cookies does not prevent you from using the site; you may still see non-personalized ads.
                </p>
                <p className="mt-2">
                  Local storage also keeps in-progress answers, timer state and preferences so practice can survive a refresh. IP addresses may be processed temporarily for abuse prevention and rate limiting; old rate-limit rows are removed automatically.

                </ul>
                <p className="mt-2">
                  You have the right to access, rectify, or erase your personal data; to restrict or object to its processing; to data portability; and to withdraw consent at any time (without affecting the lawfulness of processing before withdrawal).

                <p>
                  We do not sell your personal information for money. We share information only with: (a) service providers who process data on our behalf (such as hosting, authentication, database storage, analytics, transactional email, payment processing and AI scoring); (b) advertising partners as described in Section 5; and (c) authorities where required by law. We may also share anonymized, aggregated data for analytical purposes. Where your data is transferred outside your country (including transfers from the EEA/UK to the United States), we rely on appropriate safeguards such as standard contractual clauses or our providers&apos; participation in recognized data transfer frameworks.

                <p>
                  We retain personal information only as long as necessary for the purposes described in this policy: newsletter email addresses are kept until you unsubscribe or request deletion; account and practice data are kept while your account is active or until you request deletion; analytics and log data are retained per our providers&apos; standard retention periods; and correspondence is kept as long as needed to handle your inquiry and comply with legal obligations. We use access controls, encrypted connections, row-level database policies, rate limits and restricted server credentials, but no online service can guarantee absolute security.
